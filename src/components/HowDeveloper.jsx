          <p className='bg-stone-100 p-2 rounded-lg italic  dark:bg-stone-700 dark:text-stone-200'>

    Like many children, I grew up with big dreams. Mine was to become a doctor so I could help others, because I have always been a kind person who genuinely cares about people in need. My father, however, always encouraged me to explore and go deeper into technology.

    After completing Senior 3 in secondary school, it was time to choose a subject combination to specialize in. I had two options:

    PCB (Physics, Chemistry, and Biology), which would lead me toward becoming a doctor.

    SOD (Software Development), which would lead me into the tech world.

    Due to my grades, I was given the chance to study Software Development. At first, I wasn’t as happy as I would have been if I had been selected for PCB. But later, I began to realize that technology is my true passion.

    As someone who values kindness and problem-solving, I saw technology—especially web development—as a way to solve problems worldwide. I began researching web development, learning what skills were needed to create outstanding websites. That’s how I discovered my true calling in web development, and now, I truly love what I do.</p>
